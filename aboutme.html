			<h3>Research</h3>
			<p>
				I am a senior programmer at Columbia University's <a href="http://www.publichealth.columbia.edu">Mailman School of Public Health</a>, working in the <a href="http://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/environmental-health-sciences-ehs">Department of Environmental Health Sciences</a>. Broadly, I'm interested in developing and applying machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms for problems in public health and clinical healthcare / medicine. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Currently, I'm fortunate to be working under the mentorship of Dr. <a href="http://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/mk3961">Marianthi-Anna Kioumourtzoglou</a> as a part of her group, <a href="https://marianthi.github.io/makLAB.github.io/">makLab</a>. My most recent research at Mailman has focused on the development of interpretable machine learning methods for assessing complex mixtures of environmental exposures. In this work, I've had the pleasure of collaborating with many incredible colleagues, including Drs. <a href='http://jeffgoldsmith.com'>Jeff Goldsmith</a> and <a href='http://www.columbia.edu/~jw2966/'>John Wright</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2020, I also conducted research in natural language processing at Columbia's <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu">Computer Science Department</a> under Dr. <a href='http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kathy/'>Kathleen McKeown</a>. I worked to help develop automatic fact-checking models to combat misinformation surrounding COVID-19, climate change, and the 2020 U.S. presidential election. 
			</p>
			<h3>Education</h3>
			<p>
				I graduated from Columbia University in May of 2020 with a BA in Computer Science, specializing in Intelligent Systems.
